# Fin or Fate: Choose the Current

# What is the project? What is the overall concept and theme? What kind of experience were you striving to create?
Our project revolves around a fish who serves as the main character of a choose your own adventure story. The overall concept centers around the horizontal movement of the fish throughout the scenes as we view his trials and tribulations throughout. 

## Scenes
**It begins with:**
1.	The fish swimming happily in the ocean
2.	A fishing net swoops in and catches it 
3.	The fish ends up in a bag to be sold at a carnival game and gets won by a young girl
4.	The viewer then gets to choose if the fish ends up in an aquarium or a fishbowl

**If the viewer chooses the fishbowl, the fish gets a sad ending:**


5.	We see the fish sad in a fishbowl in the girl’s bedroom
6.	The fish gets sick and dies overnight
7.	The fish gets flushed down the toilet

**OR**

**If the viewer chooses the aquarium, the fish gets a happy ending:**

5.	We see the fish happy in an aquarium in the girl’s bedroom
6.	The fish finds a partner/ soulmate
7.	They have a baby together and you see their happy family

The experience we were striving to create was centered largely around movement and interaction. We wanted the viewer to have a say in how the story went, while also being able to appreciate the simple yet effective visuals portrayed through the movement and design. Sneheel and QM did the coding for the movement and website layout, but Buka and I covered the illustration and design.

# Describe your role and what your contribution was. How did you go about implementing the concept?

My role was centered on designing the scenes. I designed half, while Buka designed the other half. We chose to go for a simple, cartoon-y, marker-drawn monochrome black-and-white look with a focus on the simplicity of the story—we didn’t want it to be too overwhelming especially since the fish would be moving across the screen. We focused on making the scenes seem comic-like with the textboxes and scene frames, while also adding our own style through the doodling look we ended up going for. 

We used Procreate to illustrate the scenes and characters.
