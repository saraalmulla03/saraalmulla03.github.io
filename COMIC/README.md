# Fin or Fate: Choose the Current

# What is the project? What is the overall concept and theme? What kind of experience were you striving to create?
Our project revolves around a fish who serves as the main character of a choose your own adventure story. The overall concept centers around the horizontal movement of the fish throughout the scenes as we view his trials and tribulations throughout. 

## Scenes
**It begins with:**
1.	The fish swimming happily in the ocean
2.	A fishing net swoops in and catches it 
3.	The fish ends up in a bag to be sold at a carnival game and gets won by a young girl
4.	The viewer then gets to choose if the fish ends up in an aquarium or a fishbowl

**If the viewer chooses the fishbowl, the fish gets a sad ending:**


5.	We see the fish sad in a fishbowl in the girl’s bedroom
6.	The fish gets sick and dies overnight
7.	The fish gets flushed down the toilet

**OR**

**If the viewer chooses the aquarium, the fish gets a happy ending:**

5.	We see the fish happy in an aquarium in the girl’s bedroom
6.	The fish finds a partner/ soulmate
7.	They have a baby together and you see their happy family

The experience we were striving to create was centered largely around movement and interaction. We wanted the viewer to have a say in how the story went, while also being able to appreciate the simple yet effective visuals portrayed through the movement and design. Sneheel and QM did the coding for the movement and website layout, but Buka and I covered the illustration and design.

# Describe your role and what your contribution was. How did you go about implementing the concept?

My role was centered on designing the scenes. I designed half, while Buka designed the other half. We chose to go for a simple, cartoon-y, marker-drawn monochrome black-and-white look with a focus on the simplicity of the story— we didn’t want it to be too overwhelming especially since the fish would be moving across the screen. We focused on making the scenes seem comic-like with the textboxes and scene frames, while also adding our own style through the doodling aesthetic we ended up going for. 

We used Procreate to illustrate the scenes and characters.

- Buka illustrated the bedroom, and I illustrated the décor in it (i.e., the heart pillow, dotted duvet, teddy bear, taped drawings, fishbowl, etc)

-	For the sad ending, we had the idea of inverting the colors to match the mood (white to black), which added more to the visual element while also complimenting the funereal symbolism of the moment.

## I also designed the main character:

## And the balloons that flow in:

## For the fish that Buka illustrated, we made it into a PNG, and I illustrated a facial expression pack that we could alternate with depending on the scene.

## After finalizing each design, I added text boxes like those seen frequently in comics:

# Reflection/Evaluation (initial vs final concept, expectations and goals):

I was initially worried about how I would illustrate the scenes. Once we agreed on the style and layout, however, things came more naturally, and we were able to storyboard effectively. After I finished a scene, I showed it to my team members in case they had any feedback or felt that modifications needed to be made, which helped clarify the creative vision.

## I had to redesign the carnival scene twice because we weren’t 100% sure about how we wanted it to look, which delayed finalizing it as we reiterated the possible designs:

We did eventually come up with a solution (Frame 3), which was to change the perspectives completely so that the frame was more centered on the girl rather than the background. This helped tie everything together and make the frame feel and look more cohesive.

## Image references
What helped in producing the scenes was image references. During the illustrative process, I often searched for clipart versions of images I wanted to illustrate, which helped me visualize how I wanted the frames to look (ex. Ferris wheel, carnival tent, fishbowl, toilet) and in turn helped me modify each element to suit our styling.

(ADD EXAMPLES)

My expectations and goals were exceeded for this assignment. I think our group worked very well together—we were all on the same page and often agreed with each other, but were still vocal about any changes that needed to be made on the creative or technical side.
